    𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢-𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝟐-𝐓𝐢𝐞𝐫 𝐖𝐞𝐛 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐧 𝐆𝐂𝐏 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐆𝐢𝐭𝐇𝐮𝐛 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬" 🚀

In this project, I utilized various GCP resources to build a robust, scalable, and highly available architecture including:

• 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 🌐
• 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 𝐂𝐃𝐍 ⚡
• 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 📦
• 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 𝐈𝐀𝐌 🔒 
• 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐫 🔑
• 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 𝐍𝐀𝐓 🌐
• 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞 💻
• 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 𝐒𝐐𝐋 🗄️

And more!

I ensured that the system adheres to key design principles:

🔄 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠: Ensures even distribution of traffic and reduces single points of failure.
🗃️ 𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠: Improves performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the users.
🌍 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡 𝐀𝐯𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms across multiple regions.
📈 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Automatically scales resources to handle increased load.
🛡️ 𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲: Implements stringent access controls, encryption, and secure management of secrets.
📜 𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: Keeps track of changes to the infrastructure code, enabling rollbacks and better collaboration.

By leveraging 𝐓𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦 for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and 𝐆𝐢𝐭𝐇𝐮𝐛 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 for continuous deployment, I streamlined the setup and management of the entire architecture.
